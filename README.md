# UNIT 1: FINTECH CASE STUDY ASSIGNMENT 

## Overview and Origin

* KOHO Financial Inc. (‘KOHO’ or ‘the corporation’) is a Canadian FinTech company, operating specifically in the Payments/Billing domain as a neobank, i.e., 
"a firm that offers apps, software and other technologies to streamline mobile and online banking" (Forbes, 2021). KOHO was  incorporated in 2014 by its founder Daniel Eberhard,
in an effort to simplify everyday banking transactions for ‘underbanked’ consumers, while cutting out the fees that major Canadian banks usually charge. 
The corporation’s objective is therefore to offer its customers everyday convenience at an affordable price. To date, the corporation has received $350m, including its recently 
completed Series D funding round of $210m in January 2022 (KOHO, 2022). 

## Business Activities:  
* KOHO tries to solve the specific financial problems of high banking fees (especially for lower-income, underbanked consumers), lack of access to credit for some Canadians, low
interest in conventional/traditional bank accounts, low liquidity (for customers living ‘paycheque to paycheque’) and a lack of convenience (with many of its customers unable to
access traditional banks during office hours).

* The company’s intended customers are lower-income Canadian consumers, who are either under-banked or unbanked (28% and 6% of the working age population respectively) as well as
those consumers living ‘paycheque to paycheque’ (up to 50% of the workforce, according to Betakit, 2022). Given the 19.4m people employed in Canada in December 2021 
(tradingeconomics.com), KOHO’s target market ranges from approximately 5.4m to 9.7m consumers, compared to its current 500,000 active monthly users, implying significant growth 
potential for the corporation. 

* KOHO competes with traditional Canadian banks (RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC, and National) and other neobanks including Brightside, Mogo, Mydoh, Stack and Neo Financial 
(neobanks.app, 2021). In doing so, KOHO offers its customers various services that the traditional banks do not. These services include high interest rates on positive debit 
card balances (compared to an average of 0.01% per annum for checking accounts with conventional Canadian banks), fully digital banking for customers on the go(through its app 
or website, while traditional banks require a meeting or call with customers for some transactions), cash back on all its debit card transactions (only available on qualifying 
transactions by traditional banks), low-balance credit lines at an affordable fee of $7/month (compared to traditional banks that charge upwards of $100 annually plus interest 
for credit card usage ), early access to customers’ paycheques through Instant Pay ( a service that competitor Neo Financial does not currently have) and so-called no-fee 
debit cards (while most banks require a minimum checking account balance to waive their monthly fees). 

* As a neobank, KOHO uses several technologies to provide its services detailed above. These technologies are broadly split into three main categories, namely 
(1) Hosting infrastructure, (2) Open-source core platform architecture and (3) Front-end applications for its customers (twimbit.com, 2021). The corporation’s hosting 
infrastructure is comprised exclusively of cloud services. While KOHO does not disclose its cloud service provider,  it is likely that the corporation 
(with its growing customer base and transaction volumes) would opt to use any of the larger cloud providers, such as  Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, 
IBM cloud, Oracle, Salesforce, or SAP to keep scaling its operations well into the future. 

KOHO’s open-source core platform architecture is comprised of a core infrastructure platform, an API platform and an open eco-system. The core infrastructure platform is comprised
of a CRM system and a core banking system. While KOHO doesn’t disclose its CRM software package, we estimate that the corporation would use a leading CRM package like Salesforce,
Oracle Sales Cloud or SugarCRM (Forbes, 2019). While we do not have information on KOHO’s core banking system (defined by Gartner as  KOHO’s “back-end system that processes daily 
banking transactions and posts updates to accounts and other financial records”), we estimate that KOHO uses the same core banking system as People’s Trust Company and Visa, 
with whom KOHO partners to provide its savings and spending accounts and debit cards. Similarly, we also estimate that KOHO uses People’s Trust and Visa’s API platforms and 
open ecosystems, which initiate payments from KOHO’s customers’ accounts. Finally, KOHO’s front-end applications for its customers are comprised of the KOHO Financial mobile 
banking app (available via the Apple App Store, Android and Google Play), its internet banking service (www.koho.ca) and third-party services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, 
where customers can store their debit card information for use in transactions. 

## Landscape: 
* KOHO operates in the Payments/Billing domain of the financial industry.

* The Payments/Billing domain has experienced the following major trends over the past 5-10 years: 
•	Significant growth in mobile or online payments: This has been driven by rapid growth in eCommerce transactions in developed markets (Europe and North America), and by 
the proliferation of mobile phones in emerging markets (Asia and Africa). The mobile/online payments market experienced a surge in activity in 2020/2021, due to strong 
transaction volumes, following the reduction of in-person shopping and dining during the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, McKinsey estimates that mobile/online payments growth 
will decelerate to around 6% annually by 2025, due to slower growth in emerging markets. 
•	Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning: Companies in the Payments/Billing domain have increasingly used AI to detect fraud and to automate processes (codete.com, 2021). 
From an innovation standpoint,  some companies in this domain (specifically the banks) have started using AI and Machine Learning to predict future customer spending by 
analyzing their historical data, which allows them to recommend a customer-specific product (e.g., a new type of card with more favourable fees or more flexible payment terms).  
•	Mobile commerce: According to codete.com (2021) the average person uses their mobile phone for 4hrs per day. This trend has been monetized by social media apps 
(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Weibo), that have partnered with third party retailers to include a “buy” function on their mobile apps. As a result, tens of thousands of 
retailers (including smaller or medium-size  enterprises) are now able to significantly grow their revenues by  selling their products directly to consumers on their favourite 
social media platform. 
•	Increased Cross-border transactions: Given increased immigration and the need for immigrant populations to remit funds to their relatives in their home country, FinTech 
companies like Remitly, Wise (previously Transfer Wise) and Send have been leaders in offering fast offshore currency remittances (usually 1-2 days) for no or very low fees, 
at a more favourable exchange rate than the banks or traditional remittance services like Western Union. These FinTech remittance processors also offer their customers added 
flexibility, by allowing them to transact on their mobile devices at any time, rather than visiting a bank/remittance firm during office hours. 
•	Increased collaboration between FinTech disruptors and traditional service providers: For example, PayPal’s 2018 acquisition of Zettle, Fiserv’s 2019 merger with First Data 
and Visa’s  abandoned 2020 acquisition of Plaid. 
 
* The global Payments/Billings domain is comprised of hundreds of companies. However, the domain’s major players include Wise, Remitly, Stripe (which offers payment processing 
for eCommerce websites), Circle ( a peer-to -peer payments firm), Braintree (now a PayPal subsidiary), and Clover Network (a cloud-based Point of Sale platform, now owned by 
Fiserv). 

## Results 
* Business impact: While KOHO was incorporated in 2014, it only commenced operations in 2017. Since then, its most notable business impact has been the growth of its account 
base to 500,000 users across Canada, following the increased adoption of its low-fee debit cards, high-interest (income) bank accounts, and low-fee credit lines. The company 
has grown its headcount to 250 employees and intends to hire 150 more staff following the completion of its January 2022 Series D funding round. 

* Core metrics that companies in this domain use include:
 Average user growth.
 Average revenue per user (ARPU).
 Cost or gross profit per new user.
 Marketing expenditure growth. 
 Total expenditure growth rate. 
 Client acquisition costs. 

It is difficult to compare KOHO’s performance relative to its closest Canadian peer, Neo Financial, as the latter only started operations in 2019 and has not disclosed its 
user numbers. Further, neither KOHO nor Neo Financial publicly disclose their financial statements as unlisted companies. 

## Recommendations 
* To give KOHO an edge over Neo Financial or potential future competitors, I would advise the corporation to offer the following additional products/services: 
Offshore remittances for the immigrant community (this would be especially popular in a country like Canada with its large immigrant population). 
The ability for new customers to sign up for any of KOHO’s existing or new services on its ‘GetKOHO’ Instagram page (and Facebook equivalent), similar to how social media 
users can purchase goods from their favourite store’s social media page. 

* In my view, offering offshore remittances would benefit KOHO by significantly increasing its number of users (and thus its revenue), relative to Neo Financial. The global 
remittances industry currently generates US$600bn in annual revenue (retaildive.com, 2020), so capturing even a tiny fraction of that market share would be lucrative for KOHO. 
Similarly, allowing new users to sign up for any of KOHO’s services on social media (a service that its competitor does not currently offer) would also increase KOHO’s active 
user base and revenue. 

* To offer global remittance services, KOHO will need to use RegTech software, to ensure compliance with KYC (know your client) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, as 
well as to prevent or detect fraud. KOHO can purchase this software from Trulioo, a Canadian company whose GlobalGateway™ service offers identity verification, ID document 
verification, business verification and AML watchlist verification.  Further, KOHO will also need to use Trulioo’s GlobalGateway™ package to sign up new customers on its social
media pages and to mitigate the risk of fraud and money laundering. 

* Trulioo’s technology is appropriate for KOHO, as the package has been used by major banks, Facebook, Google and LinkedIn to verify identities for 8 years.
